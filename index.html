        <h1>Bouldering cheatsheet</h1>
        <p>This page is my personal, subjective collection of bouldering related information.</p>
    </header>

        <section>
            <h2>Basic technique</h2>
            <p>As a rule of thumb, you want to climb with <strong>stretched arms</strong>.</p>
            <p>Your legs are stronger than your arms so they're way more efficient to generate power with.</p>
            <p>To get your body in a position where upwards movement can be built from our legs, use your <strong>core</strong> to create body tension.</p>
            <h3>Footwork</h3>
            <p>Precise footwork is important and often neglected. Here's some basic pointers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look at your feet when moving.</li>
                <li>Try to aim for slow, controlled movement instead of rapid bursts.</li>
                <li>Place your tip exactly where you want it.</li>
                <li>Don't bounce your foot to test the hold. Place, re-adjust and stick.</li>
                <li>On volumes, place the entire foot down to get as much contact surface with the volume as possible, as opposed to using your tip.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Balance</h3>
            <p>To stay balanced on the wall, you want to aim for <strong>2 diagonal points of contact</strong>. Pairing your left hand with your left foot, or right hand/right foot, is bad news.</p>
            <p>Try to find opposite holds, a good right hand with a left foot and flag your right leg out.</p>
            <a href=https://www.radrookies.com/rock-climbing-barn-door-and-how-to-fix-it/>This article does a great job at explaining it.</a>
            <h3>Flagging</h3>
            <p>To prevent swinging to the side and to keep your center of gravity above the hold you're standing on, you can stretch the leg that isn't supporting you outwards and press it against the wall.</p>
            <p>Don't forget to actively press with the foot you're flagging.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Route reading</h2>
            <p>Essential skill. Visualize the sequence in your head. Doing the entire thing takes practice, so start with just hands.</p>
            <p>Don't stop once you figure out the first couple of holds. The end is usually the hardest because by then you're already exhausted so take the extra time to map everything out.</p>
            <p class="tip">Measure yourself in holes by standing next to the wall. Now you have an idea of your reach when trying to visualize yourself climbing a route.</p>
            <h3>Hold direction</h3>
            <p>Most holds have an obvious way you should be holding them, which tells you a lot about how your body should be positioned once you reach that part of the problem.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Dynamic moves</h2>
            <p>Keep hands on the holds as long as possible. Move arms sideways.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Warm-up</h2>
            <p>Start with basic cardio to get your heart rate up. Either bike/run to the gym or do pushups/jumping jacks to get warm once you get there.</p>
            <p>Next, loosen up by doing a combination of the following exercices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>arm circles</li>
                <li>horizontal cross-over swings</li>
                <li>torso spins</li>
                <li>leg swings (frontal + sideways)</li>
                <li>sideway lunges</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you feel adequately warmed up, start with a first set of easy routes. Climb 3-5 green (very easy) routes <strong>both up and down</strong>.</p>
            <p>You can practice your diagonal positioning by taking a 2 second "rest" on each hold, with only 2 points of contact. E.g: start with your left hand and right foot on a hold. Maintain for 2 seconds. Move to a right hand, left foot position and find your balance. Maintain for 2 seconds. Etc...</p>
            <p>This is also a great time to focus on footwork. A solid exercise for this is silent climbing. Do 5 push-ups for each time you bump into the wall/hold and make a sound.</p>

            <h2>Climbing exercices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4x4</li>
                <li>Eliminator</li>
                <li>Point & go</li>
                <li>Build your own route</li>
                <li>Traversing / training wall circuits</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Off-the-wall exercices</h2>
            <p>These exercices can be done either at the end of a climbing session or on days when you can't get to the gym.</p>
            <p>Each list is 1 set. You can do both, mix or just pick one. Aim for 3 to 5 sets depending on level. 1 minute rest between each exercice.</p>
            <h3>Core</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1m Superman</li>
                <li>1m Leg stretches, with elbow support</li>
                <li>30s ~ 1m Plank (regular and each side, so 3x total)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strength</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 ~ 12 pull-ups</li>
                <li>6 ~ 12 push-ups</li>
                <li>6 ~ 12 dips</li>
                <li>6 ~ 12 rows</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All numbers can be increased. Variations can be used to increase difficulty (narrow pull-ups, diamond/ninja push-ups, rings for rows, etc..), but <strong>quality > quantity</strong>.

        <section>
            <h2>Stretching</h2>
            <p>Stretching is mandatory. It prevents injuries, increases flexibility and prevents the muscles from shortening. A climber should stretch after every session.</p>
            <p>The ones that I personally like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sit on your knees and lean forward with your arms stretched out.</li>
                <li>Sit cross-legged with a straight back and push your knees down.</li>
                <li>Press your palms together and push your arms down.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rest days</h2>
            <p>A wise man once said:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Never climb 2 days in a row during your first year of climbing
            </blockquote>
            <p>When you start to climb you need to give your tendons and muscles enough time to adjust to the stress climbing puts on them. If you do cheat on this rule, <strong>listen to your body</strong>.</p>
            <p>I personally follow something like this:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Mon</th>
                        <th>Tue</th>
                        <th>Wed</th>
                        <th>Thu</th>
                        <th>Fri</th>
                        <th>Sat</th>
                        <th>Sun</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Climb</td>
                        <td>Rest</td>
                        <td>Climb</td>
                        <td>Rest</td>
                        <td>Rest</td>
                        <td>Climb</td>
                        <td>Rest</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>A rest day can be either full on rest or doing some light cardio (walk/bike), light exercises and/or stretching.</p>
