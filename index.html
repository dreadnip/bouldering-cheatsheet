        <h1>Bouldering cheatsheet</h1>
        <p>This page is a collection of bouldering related information that I've gathered and consult on a regular basis. I forget a lot of information and writing it down helps me remember.</p>

            <h2>Basic technique</h2>
            <p>As a rule of thumb, you want to climb with <strong>stretched arms</strong>.</p>
            <p>Your legs are stronger than your arms so they're way more efficient to generate power with.</p>
            <p>To get your body in a position where upwards movement can be built from our legs, use your <strong>core</strong>.</p>
            <h3>Footwork</h3>
            <p>Precise footwork is important and often neglected. Here's some basic pointers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look at your feet when moving.</li>
                <li>Try to aim for slow, controlled movement instead of rapid bursts.</li>
                <li>Place your tip exactly where you want it.</li>
                <li>Don't bounce your foot to test the hold. Place, re-adjust and stick.</li>
                <li>On volumes, place the entire foot down to get as much contact surface with the volume as possible, as opposed to using your tip.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Flagging</h3>

            <h2>Warm-up</h2>
            <p>Start with basic cardio to get your heart rate up. Either bike/run to the gym or do pushups/jumping jacks to get warm once you get there.</p>
            <p>Next, loosen up by doing a combination of the following exercices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>arm circles</li>
                <li>horizontal cross-over swings</li>
                <li>torso spins</li>
                <li>leg swings (frontal + sideways)</li>
                <li>sideway lunges</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you feel adequately warmed up, start with a first set of easy routes. Climb 3-5 green (very easy) routes <strong>both up and down</strong>.</p>
            <p>You can practice your diagonal positioning by taking a 2 second "rest" on each hold, with only 2 points of contact. E.g: start with your left hand and right foot on a hold. Maintain for 2 seconds. Move to a right hand, left foot position and find your balance. Maintain for 2 seconds. Etc...</p>
            <p>This is also a great time to focus on footwork. A solid exercise for this is silent climbing. Do 5 push-ups for each time you bump into the wall/hold and make a sound.</p>

            <h2>Stretching</h2>
            <p>Stretching is mandatory. It prevents injuries, increases flexibility and prevents the muscles from shortening. I should stretch after every session.</p>
            <p>My favourite stretches:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sitting down arm stretch</li>
                <li>Knees down</li>

            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Route reading</h2>
            <p>Essential skill. Visualize in your head. Start with hands. Don't stop because you're feeling good once you figure out the first few holds. Finishing is often the hardest because by then you're already exhausted so take the extra time to completely map out the last few moves as well.</p>
            <h3>Hold direction</h3>
            <p class="tip">Measure yourself in holes by standing next to the wall. Now you have an idea of your reach when trying to visualize yourself climbing a route.</p>
