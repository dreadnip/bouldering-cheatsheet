climbing techniques:
left/right foot-hand combo
body tension - pull your ass in

precise footwork:
look at your feet when moving
slow, controlled movement
place tip exactly where you want it
no bouncing

when left/right cross isn't possible -> flag

turn hip into the wall when you want to reach with that side
e.g. far reach with right hand -> turn right hip into wall

taking this a step further:
make sure you establish a diagonal position whenever possible and flag out
to support your hip turn
e.g. far reach with right hand -> left hand is still on hold
-> look for good hold with right foot
-> flag out with left foot
-> turn right hip into wall (movement starts from core, *not* arms)
-> keep body tension
-> grab hold

try to preemptively do this by reading the route. Try to determine the direction a hold is going to be pulled on and with which hand. Then try to map out the sequence so that that hand ends up on that hold, and the reverse foot ends up supporting you when you go to that hold.

Regular session flow:

warmup:
- bike/run to gym -> if not, jumping jacks and push ups
- arm circles + horizontal swings
- thorax swings
- leg swings
- sideway lunges
==> easy climbing: focus on footwork (silent climbing) 3-5 easy routes up + down

rest

10-15 move traverses x 4 - focus on footwork

5-6 mid level routes, focus on technique (straight arms, no pulling, flagging, indraaien).
